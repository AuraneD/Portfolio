# Context

When a user visits (one of ) our websites, we collect information about keywords extracted from the website's url. For each user, the frequency of visits per keyword per day is also stored. For example, suppose that a given user has visited the two following sites recently:
html://mypage/abc-news/aaa-bbb.html html://mypage/news/aaa.html
The keywords (that have been) “seen” by the user will be then stored as follows:
abc:1;news:2;aaa:2;bbb:1;mypage:2

Solution: build a demographic prediction algorithm to obtain the age and gender of the users and avoid having to buy external data
